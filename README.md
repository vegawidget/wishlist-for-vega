# Wishlist for Vega and Vega-Lite

One of my favorite repositories is Henrik Bengtsson's [Wishlist for R](https://github.com/HenrikBengtsson/Wishlist-for-R). 

Accordingly, I would like this repository to be a place to initiate discussion of issues before we file issues with the Vega team - a place where we can try to wrap our heads around stuff.
